            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <p>Since we had the option of using restaurants.geojson, I decided to use it as I believed the data would be more secure. I was curious and wanted to use one of the APIs from NASA but some of their data was not available and others seemed hard to understand. I thought using restaurants.geojson would be more reliable and it did appear easier to read. However, the data was boring as a drawback.</p>
            <p>In Cards View, you get a quick overview of a selection of restaurants that shows you where the location is and whether or not it is compliant. Table View expands on compliance and displays information about the various criteria of compliance. Category View allows you to look at compliant, noncompliant, in-progress compliance, and unknown compliance restaurants based on what city they are located in. Stats View then allows you to look at the overall number of restaurants meeting the different criteria of compliance and the best or worst cities for finding compliant restaurants. Right now, category view probably has the most useful information but not presented in the best way. You can go to the compliance category and choose a city close by to see what restaurants are probably safe to eat at. I think the table view could have had more potential as it would have allowed people to filter through different compliance details and locations.
</p>
            <p>I had a lot of challenges, but I do not think I solved them. I had a lot of difficulty with the views despite some familiarity with them, especially the table view when I tried filtering. I think there was a challenge that received some degree of success from the category view. I initially tried to categorize restaurants by cities but that was too extensive. The four categories of compliance somewhat helped break up the loads of information. Overall, it was still difficult and I didnâ€™t get to do all that I wanted to do. Some CSS and JavaScript errors ate up my time, especially in table view.</p>
