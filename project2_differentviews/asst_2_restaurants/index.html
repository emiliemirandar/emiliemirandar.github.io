            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <p>I chose to use the API for Prince George’s County’s restaurants since it carried a lot of similarities and restaurants from restaurants.geojson. I was curious and wanted to use one of the APIs from NASA but some of their data was not available and others seemed hard to understand. I thought using this API, having been familiar with restaurants.geojson would be more reliable and it did appear easier to read.</p>
            <p>In cards view, you get a quick, randomly selected overview of PG County restaurants that shows you where the location is and whether or not it is compliant. Table view expands on compliance and displays information about the various criteria of compliance. Category view allows you to look at compliant, noncompliant, compliance schedules, and unknown compliance restaurants based on what city they are located in. Stats view then allows you to look at the overall number of restaurants meeting the different criteria of compliance and the best or worst cities for finding compliant restaurants. Right now, table view probably has the most useful information as it goes deeper into the compliance results, which are a bit misleading since restaurants can fail other inspections criteria and still be listed as compliant.</p>
            <p>I had a lot of difficulty with the views despite some familiarity with them, especially when I tried filtering. I think there was a challenge that received some degree of success from the category view. I initially tried to categorize restaurants by cities but that was too extensive. The four categories of compliance somewhat helped break up the loads of information. I think that category view could still be a lot better. I could potentially think of a different criteria. Overall, it was still difficult and some CSS and JavaScript errors ate up my time, especially in table view.</p>
